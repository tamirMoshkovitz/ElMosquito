## Game Description

You are not just a mosquito ‚Äî you're **the** mosquito.

Your mission: **bite down** a dude on a train before he slaps you dead.  
This one-level boss fight combines reactive AI, procedural animation, and decorator-driven upgrades in a fast-paced, precision-driven experience.

## Boss Design: 2 Phases of Pain

1. **Phase 1 ‚Äì The Seated Slapper**  
   - He sits. You bite. He slaps.  
   - Procedural slap animations.  
   - Your job: sneak in, bite exposed skin, and dodge the hands.

2. **Phase 2 ‚Äì The Pursuer**  
   - At 33% HP, he **gets up and starts chasing you**.  
   - Slaps remain procedural, but now he moves with intent.  
   - The pressure ramps up - tighter spacing, less recovery time, and constant pursuit.
