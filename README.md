### Code Highlights

##### OOP principles

- Follows SOLID principles for clean, maintainable architecture

##### Design Patterns:

- Singleton
- Observer
- Decorator
- Object Pooling
  
##### Scalability

The code is designed to be highly modular and easily extensible, allowing:
- Simple integration of new powerups
- Addition of new boss phases, attack logic, or AI states
- Expansion of audio systems, UI elements, and gameplay features with minimal changes

## Game Description

Your mission: **bite down** a dude on a train before he slaps you dead.  
This one-level boss fight combines reactive AI, procedural animation, and decorator-driven upgrades in a fast-paced, precision-driven experience.

## Boss Design: 2 Phases

1. **Phase 1 ‚Äì The Seated Slapper**  
   - He sits. You bite. He slaps.  
   - Procedural slap animations.  
   - Your job: sneak in, bite exposed skin, and dodge the hands.

2. **Phase 2 ‚Äì The Pursuer**  
   - At 33% HP, he **gets up and starts chasing you**.  
   - Slaps remain procedural, but now he moves with intent.  
   - The pressure ramps up - tighter spacing, less recovery time, and constant pursuit.

## Controls
(the game is made for a gamepad)

| Action       | Input                |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Move         | Right Stick          |
| Boost        | Double Click L1      |

## Notable Systems

### Inverse Kinematic Slap System  
- Boss arms use **Cinemachine path + TwoBoneIK**  
- Attacks trigger based on player distance and randomized reaction timing

### Decorator-Based Mosquito Powerups
- Speed, Maneuverability, and Damage buffs stack via the Decorator pattern  
- Power-up stack is reversible ‚Äì buffs are lost when hit
